Explanation of Key Folders and Files:
1. /backend-go (Go Microservice)
/cmd/server: This folder contains the main entry point for the Go service. It includes the code that starts the server and listens for HTTP requests.

/pkg/handlers: Contains HTTP request handlers for various endpoints such as /transactions, /users, /budgets, etc.

/pkg/services: This folder contains core business logic, such as budget calculations, transaction handling, etc.

/pkg/db: Handles database connections and provides query functions to interact with PostgreSQL.

/api/v1/: The API definitions, versioned by /v1, to separate future versions of your API.

2. /backend-python (Python Microservice)
/app: Contains the main Python code for the microservice (e.g., Flask app and routes).

/ml: Contains machine learning models for tasks such as transaction categorization, anomaly detection, and insights generation.

/services: Business logic for financial predictions, insights, or anomaly detection.

/api: REST API routes for Python services that expose ML-powered endpoints or other utility services.

/config: Configuration files for API keys, database connections, or other settings.

requirements.txt: Lists all Python dependencies that are needed for the project.

3. /frontend-react (React.js Application)
/public: Static files like index.html and images.

/src: The main source code for the React app, including components, pages, hooks, contexts, and services for API calls.

/services: Contains utility functions for interacting with the Go and Python backend APIs.

/styles: Contains all styles, such as CSS or SCSS files.

/tests: Contains frontend tests, which may be written using tools like Jest and React Testing Library.

4. /infrastructure
docker-compose.yml: Manages Docker containers for the whole app. For example, you can configure services like the Go backend, Python microservices, React frontend, and PostgreSQL database.

/k8s: Kubernetes manifests for deploying the application in a cloud environment.

/terraform: Infrastructure as code (IaC) using Terraform to provision cloud resources.

5. /database
/migrations: Contains SQL migration files to evolve the database schema.

/seeders: Scripts to populate the database with initial sample data.

6. /docs
architecture.md: Describes the overall architecture, including the interaction between the Go and Python microservices, the database, and the frontend.

api_docs.md: Documents the API endpoints provided by both the Go backend and Python microservices.

database_schema.md: Provides an overview of the database schema and relations.

7. /tests
Contains unit and integration tests for Go, Python, and React.
